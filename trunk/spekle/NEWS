New Features And Enhancements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spek 0.6 is part of beta 0.x releases, leading up to a stable 1.0 release
later this year. Check Spek website for the roadmap.

New features since 0.5:

 * Switch from GStreamer to FFmpeg libraries for audio decoding. This
   speeds up the overall analysis by a factor of 1.5 to 2.
 * Decode audio and perform the analysis in separate threads. This makes
   the analysis 1.3~1.8 times faster on multi-core systems (issue 11).
 * Check for a new version once a week and notify when it becomes
   available (issue 27)

Enhancements:

 * Windows installer branding (issue 32)
 * Option to launch Spek when the Windows installer exits

Bugfixes:

 * Fix link activation on Windows (issue 31)
 * Fix ALAC issues on OS X (issue 23)
 * Re-run the analysis only if the window width has been changed
 * Fix opening of files containing Unicode symbols in their name on Windows
